Hey there! I'm Oberon Berlage.
</p>
<u>Work Experience</u> I have worked as a freelance software engineer on several projects in data engineering, frontend & backend development. I currently work at <b><a href="https://appjection.nl" class="ext">Appjection</a></b> as a full-stack software engineer on the automation of legal processes (which is surprisingly fun!).

<u>Degrees</u> I have a <b>Bsc.</b> in <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/Education-Programmes/Bachelor/bsc-programmes/bsc-food-technology/programme.htm"  class="ext">Food Technology</a>, with a major in Process Engineering and Process Optimisation, from <a href="https://wageningenur.nl/en.htm"  class="ext">Wageningen University</a> and a <b>MSc. in <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/information-studies-data-science/data-science.html"  class="ext">Data Science</a></b> from the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en" class="ext">University of Amsterdam</a>. I wrote my masterthesis on <a href="https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=690973" class="ext">improving the automated segmentation of radio shows using audio embeddings</a>, which was graded 9/10.

<h2>Skills</h2>

<u>Software Engineering</u> I write code in several languages, and currently use <b>Python</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>PHP</b> on a day-to-day basis. I have some experience with <b>Java</b> and <b>Go</b>. I've used webdevelopment frameworks like <i>Laravel</i>, <i>React</i>, and <i>Firebase</i>. I'm comfortable using relational databases such as <b>MySQL</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> and have some experience with non-relational databases such as <b>ElasticSearch</b>, <b>Firestore</b> and <b>MongoDB</b>. I know my way around on the <b>command-line</b> and never start a project without using <b>git</b>.
